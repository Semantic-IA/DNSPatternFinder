DNSPatternFinder.py
===================

A basic implementation that finds the DNS Patterns created when viewing a
Website. Meant to be used to generate the Database for the
[Simulator for semantic intersection attacks](https://github.com/Semantic-IA/DRQPatternAttack)
on the DNS Range Query algorithm proposed by Zhao et al.

# Dependencies

* [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs)

# Usage

# Bugs

At the time of the last run, there were some bugs in PhantomJS leading to errors not being
caught by the provided error handlers and instead being written to the output file. Manual checking
of the results is recommended.

Also, the program had the tendency to deadlock after a while. It is unknown why this happened,
but you should occasionally check if the program is still doing work.
